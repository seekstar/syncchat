# syncchat

#### Description

An IM software. Just for fun.

#### Software Architecture

The software is based on C/S architecture. The communication between the server and the client is based on SSL. The passwords of users are hashed with salt.

The software is developed on linux. But it should be easy to adapt to windows because all components used are cross-platform.

#### Installation

##### server

1. Install dependencies

    - boost
    - openssl
    - unixodbc

2. cd to the root of the project
3. Compile server

    ```shell
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ```

    Then the executable of server is in the directory "build".

4. Configure odbc data source

    The name of data source should be "syncchatserver". Here is an article about the configuration of odbc data source for mariadb on linux:

5. Prepare certificates for server

    You need to put server.pem and dh2048.pem in the same directory as the executable of server.
    You can find the demo certificate in the directory "demo".
